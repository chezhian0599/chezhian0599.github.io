# Python Interpreter

## What is a Python Interpreter

A Python interpreter is software that reads and executes Python code. When a programmer writes source code in Python, the interpreter compiles it into bytecode **(a lower-level, platform-independent representation)**. This bytecode is then executed by the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**, which further interacts with the underlying machine code executed by the CPU.

## Why Python is called an Interpreted Language

Python is called an **interpreted language** because the source code is not directly compiled into machine code beforehand. Instead, the Python interpreter processes the code, compiles it into bytecode, and executes it line by line using the Python Virtual Machine during runtime.
